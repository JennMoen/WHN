Her spontaneous responses to architectural structures introduce a tension between the built environment and our lived experience of such spaces, emphasizing movement, color, and the play of light, which alters as the day progresses. Asia Society Texas Center architect Yoshio Taniguchi’s vision of the Fayez Sarofim Grand Hall is the ideal “palette” for Yamaguchi to use, allowing her to create ephemeral sculptures that are in direct relationship to the Texas Center’s building and the larger environment of Houston. The artist’s conceptual concerns of balancing free will with our inescapable interconnectedness, and our vulnerability to art with its powerfully transformative effects, draw viewers into sustained engagement with these wonderfully inventive and expansive expressions.Image: Yuriko Yamaguchi, Embrace (detail), 2013, Hand cast resin, stainless steel wire, and LED light, Courtesy of the artist",
